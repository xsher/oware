### Repository for OWARE game

The game OWARE is written with the specifications for the course Artificial Intelligence taken at Universite Cote d'Azur.
The goal of this project is to build an Oware game that is able to compete with the other teams as part of this course.

p.s: pardon the basic implementation as it was the first time I am writing C.
